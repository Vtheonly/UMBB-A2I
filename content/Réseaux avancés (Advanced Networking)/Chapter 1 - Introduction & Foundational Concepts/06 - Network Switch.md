# Network Switch

## Corrected Context

A **network switch** is an intelligent device used to create a local area network (LAN) by connecting multiple devices. It is the modern standard for wired networking, offering significant performance and security advantages over a hub.

## How a Switch Works

A switch is an intelligent device that combines the multi-port design of a [[04 - Network Hub|Network Hub]] with the learning capability of a [[05 - Network Bridge|Network Bridge]], but on a per-port basis.

1.  It learns the unique **MAC (Media Access Control) address** of every device connected to each of its ports.
2.  This information is stored in a **MAC address table**.
3.  When a data packet arrives, the switch reads the destination MAC address and forwards the packet *only* to the port connected to the intended recipient.

This targeted delivery ensures that data is only sent where it needs to go, drastically reducing network congestion and improving security.
