# Image Representation: Bitmap vs. Vector

This note clarifies the two primary methods for digitally representing images: bitmap (or raster) and vector.

## Bitmap Images (Raster Graphics)

Bitmap images are the most common form of digital images and are the primary focus of this course.

### Definition
A bitmap image is composed of a grid of individual pixels. The image file contains the specific color or intensity value for every single pixel in the grid. This representation is analogous to a mosaic, where the overall picture is formed by a collection of small, colored tiles.

### Characteristics
-   **Resolution Dependent:** The quality of a bitmap image is directly tied to its resolution (the number of pixels). Scaling a bitmap image to a larger size requires creating new pixels (interpolation), which often results in a loss of quality, leading to pixelation or blurriness.
-   **Large File Sizes:** Storing information for every pixel can lead to large files, especially for high-resolution images. Compression techniques (like JPEG) are often used to manage file size.
-   **Ideal for Photorealism:** This pixel-by-pixel approach is perfect for representing complex, continuous-tone images like photographs and detailed digital paintings.

**Examples of Bitmap Formats:** JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF.

## Vector Images

Vector images use a different paradigm for representing visuals.

### Definition
A vector image is composed of mathematical objects such as points, lines, curves, and polygons. Instead of storing pixel values, the file stores a set of instructions that describe how to draw the image. For example, it might contain instructions like "draw a red circle with a radius of 20 pixels centered at coordinate (100, 150)."

### Characteristics
-   **Resolution Independent:** Because vector images are based on mathematical formulas, they can be scaled to any size—from a business card to a billboard—without any loss of quality. The image is simply redrawn at the new size.
-   **Small File Sizes:** Storing mathematical instructions is generally more efficient than storing millions of pixel values.
-   **Ideal for Graphics:** This format is best suited for illustrations, logos, icons, and typography, where clean lines and shapes are essential.

**Examples of Vector Formats:** SVG, AI, EPS, PDF.
