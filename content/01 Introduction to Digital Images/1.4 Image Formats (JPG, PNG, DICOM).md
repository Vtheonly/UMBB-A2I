# Common Image Formats

This note describes several common image file formats and their primary use cases. The format determines how pixel data is stored, compressed, and what kind of metadata is included.

## Core Distinction: Lossy vs. Lossless Compression

-   **Lossless Compression:** Reduces file size without discarding any image data. The original image can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed file. (e.g., PNG, TIFF).
-   **Lossy Compression:** Achieves much smaller file sizes by permanently discarding some image data. This data is chosen to be the least perceptible to the human eye. The original image cannot be perfectly recovered. (e.g., JPEG).

## Bitmap Formats

-   **JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group):**
    -   **Compression:** Lossy.
    -   **Use Case:** The most common format for photographs and other continuous-tone images on the web. It offers a great balance between image quality and file size. The compression level is adjustable, allowing a trade-off between quality and size.
    -   **Not Ideal For:** Images with sharp edges, text, or flat colors, as the compression can create visible artifacts.

-   **PNG (Portable Network Graphics):**
    -   **Compression:** Lossless.
    -   **Use Case:** Excellent for web graphics, logos, and images that require transparency (alpha channel). It preserves sharp details, text, and flat colors perfectly.
    -   **Not Ideal For:** Photographs, as the lossless compression results in significantly larger file sizes compared to JPEG without a noticeable quality benefit for that type of image.

-   **BMP (Bitmap):**
    -   **Compression:** Typically uncompressed.
    -   **Use Case:** A simple, raw format that stores pixel data directly. It is not efficient for storage or web use but can be useful for simple, programmatic image manipulation due to its straightforward structure.

-   **TIFF (Tagged Image File Format):**
    -   **Compression:** Can be lossless (LZW, ZIP) or uncompressed. Can also support lossy JPEG compression.
    -   **Use Case:** A versatile and high-quality format often used in professional photography, desktop publishing, and document archiving. It supports high bit depths and multiple layers.

-   **RAW:**
    -   **Description:** Not a single format, but a category of formats that contain minimally processed data directly from a digital camera's sensor.
    -   **Use Case:** Professional photography. It offers the maximum flexibility for post-processing adjustments (like white balance and exposure) as no data has been "baked in" by the camera's processor.

## Specialized Formats

-   **DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine):**
    -   **Description:** A standard format for storing and transmitting medical images (like MRIs, CT scans).
    -   **Insight:** DICOM is more than just an image format; it is a comprehensive protocol. A DICOM file contains not only the image data but also a rich set of metadata, including patient information, acquisition parameters, and device details, which is critical for clinical use.
