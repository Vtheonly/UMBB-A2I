This note explains how individual pixels relate to one another in terms of their spatial arrangement. Understanding these relationships—specifically adjacency, connectivity, and distance—is fundamental for nearly all image processing algorithms, from filtering to object detection.

## Adjacency and Neighbors

Adjacency defines which pixels are considered "neighbors" to a central pixel. For a pixel `P` at coordinates `(x, y)`, there are two primary definitions of its neighborhood.

### 1. 4-Neighbors (N4)
The 4-neighbors are the pixels that are directly adjacent to pixel `P` horizontally and vertically.
-   The set of coordinates for `N4(P)` is:
    `(x+1, y)`, `(x-1, y)`, `(x, y+1)`, `(x, y-1)`
-   This defines **4-connectivity**. It corresponds to pixels that are a Manhattan distance of 1 from `P`.

### 2. 8-Neighbors (N8)
The 8-neighbors include the 4-neighbors plus the four pixels that are diagonally adjacent to `P`.
-   The set of coordinates for `N8(P)` is:
    `(x+1, y)`, `(x-1, y)`, `(x, y+1)`, `(x, y-1)`,
    `(x+1, y+1)`, `(x+1, y-1)`, `(x-1, y+1)`, `(x-1, y-1)`
-   This defines **8-connectivity**. It corresponds to pixels that are a Chessboard distance of 1 from `P`.

**Insight:** The choice between 4- and 8-connectivity is significant in practice. For example, when tracing the boundary of an object in a binary image, using 4-connectivity might perceive a thin diagonal line as disconnected, while 8-connectivity would see it as a continuous path.

## Distance Metrics Between Pixels

A distance metric is a function that quantifies the spatial separation between two pixels, `P(xp, yp)` and `Q(xq, yq)`.

### 1. Euclidean Distance (d₂)
This is the standard, "straight-line" distance between two points. It is computed using the Pythagorean theorem.
-   **Formula:** `d₂(P,Q) = √((xp - xq)² + (yp - yq)²) `
-   **Use Case:** Provides a true geometric distance, but its calculation involves a square root, which can be computationally more expensive than other metrics.

### 2. Manhattan Distance (d₁ or City-Block Distance)
This metric measures the distance by summing the absolute differences of the coordinates. It is constrained to horizontal and vertical movements only, like navigating a city grid.
-   **Formula:** `d₁(P,Q) = |xp - xq| + |yp - yq|`
-   **Use Case:** Computationally very fast. It defines a neighborhood of pixels that can be reached in a certain number of non-diagonal steps.

### 3. Chebyshev Distance (d_inf or Chessboard Distance)
This metric is defined as the maximum of the absolute differences of the coordinates. It represents the minimum number of moves a king would need to travel between two squares on a chessboard.
-   **Formula:** `d_inf(P,Q) = max(|xp - xq|, |yp - yq|)`
-   **Use Case:** Useful for defining a square neighborhood where all pixels within the square are considered equidistant from the center.

### Relationship Between Metrics
For any two pixels P and Q, the distances are related by the following inequality:
`d_inf(P,Q) ≤ d₂(P,Q) ≤ d₁(P,Q)`

**Insight:** This relationship makes intuitive sense. The Chessboard distance is the "shortest" path because it allows diagonal shortcuts. The Manhattan distance is the "longest" because it's restricted to grid lines. The Euclidean distance, the true straight line, lies between these two extremes. The choice of metric depends on the specific requirements of the algorithm, often balancing between geometric accuracy and computational efficiency.
