# Image Resolution and Color Depth

This note explains the two key variables that characterize a bitmap image: spatial resolution and color depth.

## Spatial Resolution

### Definition
Spatial resolution refers to the dimensions of an image, specifically the number of pixels it contains. It is typically expressed as the product of the image's width and height in pixels (e.g., `1920 x 1080` pixels).

A higher spatial resolution means the image is composed of more pixels. This allows for greater detail and clarity, as finer features can be represented. A lower resolution image has fewer pixels, resulting in a coarser, more "blocky" appearance.

### Resolution for Display/Print (PPI/DPI)
The term "resolution" can also refer to the density of pixels within a physical area, measured in **Pixels Per Inch (PPI)** for digital displays or **Dots Per Inch (DPI)** for printing.
- `1 inch = 2.54 centimeters`
This metric determines how sharp an image appears when displayed or printed. A higher PPI means more pixels are packed into each inch, resulting in a sharper look.

**Insight:** Spatial resolution (pixel dimensions) is an intrinsic property of the digital image file itself. PPI/DPI is metadata that suggests how large the image should be when rendered on a physical medium.

## Color Depth (Bit Depth)

### Definition
Color depth determines the number of distinct colors that can be represented for each pixel in an image. It is measured in **bits per pixel (bpp)**. A higher color depth allows for a greater range of colors and smoother tonal transitions.

### Common Color Depths
-   **1-bit (Binary Image):** Each pixel can only be one of two colors (typically black or white). `2^1 = 2` values.
-   **8-bit (Grayscale):** Each pixel has one of 256 possible shades of gray. `2^8 = 256` values (from 0 to 255).
-   **24-bit (True Color):** This is the standard for most color images. It uses 8 bits for each of the three color channels (Red, Green, and Blue).
    -   `8 bits (Red) + 8 bits (Green) + 8 bits (Blue) = 24 bits`
    -   This allows for `2^24` (approximately 16.7 million) distinct colors, which is generally more than the human eye can distinguish.
