## Core Concept

Instead of operating on pixel neighborhoods, frequency domain filtering works by modifying the coefficients of the image's constituent frequencies. The general workflow is:

1.  Transform the image into the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
2.  Multiply the result by a filter mask designed to enhance or suppress certain frequencies.
3.  Transform the filtered result back into the spatial domain using the Inverse FFT.

The theoretical foundation is detailed in [[In-Depth/The Fourier Transform in Imaging]].

## Main Filter Types

### 1. Low-Pass Filter

A low-pass filter preserves low-frequency components while attenuating or removing high-frequency components.

- **Mechanism:** The filter mask has values of 1 at the center (where low frequencies are) and values of 0 towards the periphery.
- **Effect:**
  - **Smoothing and Blurring:** Removing high frequencies eliminates sharp transitions, resulting in a smoother image.
  - **Noise Reduction:** It is effective against random noise (like [[2.0 Image Noise and Degradation|Gaussian noise]]), which typically consists of high-frequency components.
- **Analogy:** This is the frequency-domain equivalent of spatial blurring filters like the [[2.2 Linear Spatial Filters (Mean, Gaussian)|mean or Gaussian filter]].

### 2. High-Pass Filter

A high-pass filter preserves high-frequency components while attenuating low-frequency components.

- **Mechanism:** The filter mask has values of 0 at the center and values of 1 towards the periphery.
- **Effect:**
  - **Edge Detection and Sharpening:** By removing the smooth, low-frequency background, the filter enhances sharp details, edges, and fine textures.
- **Analogy:** This is the frequency-domain equivalent of spatial edge detection kernels (e.g., Laplacian).

### 3. Band-Reject Filter

A band-reject filter removes a specific band of frequencies.

- **Mechanism:** The filter mask is a ring that has values of 0 within a certain frequency range and 1 everywhere else.
- **Effect:** It is particularly useful for removing structured, periodic noise. Such noise appears as distinct bright spots in the frequency spectrum, and a band-reject filter can be precisely designed to eliminate them.

### 4. Gabor Filter

The Gabor filter is a special linear filter used for texture analysis, edge detection, and feature extraction.

- **Principle:** It is a Gaussian kernel modulated by a sinusoidal plane wave.
- **Insight:** Its key property is that it is localized in both the spatial and frequency domains. This means it can be used to detect the presence of a specific frequency in a specific region of an image, making it ideal for analyzing textures that have a characteristic orientation and frequency. It is covered in more detail in [[In-Depth/Gabor Filters]].
