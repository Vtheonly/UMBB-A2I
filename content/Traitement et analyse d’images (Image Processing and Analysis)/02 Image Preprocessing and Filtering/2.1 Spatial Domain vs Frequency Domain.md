## The Spatial Domain

The **spatial domain** refers to the image plane itself, based on a Cartesian coordinate system `(x,y)`. Operations in this domain work directly on the pixel values at these coordinates.

- **Representation:** An image is a matrix of intensity or color values.
- **Operations:** Spatial filtering involves a neighborhood operation, where the value of an output pixel is determined by the values of a small neighborhood of corresponding input pixels.
- **Mechanism:** This is typically achieved using a filter mask (kernel) that slides across the image. The process is defined by [[In-Depth/Convolution]].
- **Examples of Filters:** [[2.2 Linear Spatial Filters (Mean, Gaussian)|Mean filter]], [[2.2 Linear Spatial Filters (Mean, Gaussian)|Gaussian filter]], [[2.3 Non-Linear Spatial Filters (Median, Nagao)|Median filter]], [[2.3 Non-Linear Spatial Filters (Median, Nagao)|Nagao filter]].
- **Insight:** Spatial domain filtering is intuitive and computationally efficient for small kernels. Its operations are local, modifying a pixel based on its immediate surroundings.

## The Frequency Domain

The **frequency domain** represents the image not by pixel location but by its frequency components. It describes the rate at which pixel values change across the image.

- **Representation:** The image is represented by its Fourier Transform, which decomposes the image into a sum of sine and cosine functions of different frequencies.
- **Operations:** Filtering is performed by modifying the coefficients of these frequencies in the Fourier spectrum.
- **Mechanism:** The process involves transforming the image to the frequency domain, applying a filter mask via multiplication, and then transforming it back. This is detailed in [[In-Depth/The Fourier Transform in Imaging]].
- **Examples of Filters:** [[2.4 Frequency Domain Filtering|Low-pass]], [[2.4 Frequency Domain Filtering|high-pass]], and [[2.4 Frequency Domain Filtering|band-pass filters]].
- **Insight:** The frequency domain provides a global perspective on the image. It is particularly powerful for removing periodic noise and for implementing complex filters that would require very large kernels in the spatial domain. The core advantage stems from the property that computationally expensive convolution in the spatial domain becomes simple element-wise multiplication in the frequency domain.
