## Definition

**Image Degradation** refers to any process that diminishes the quality of an image. This can include blurring, geometric distortions, poor contrast, or the introduction of noise.

**Digital Noise** is a specific form of degradation characterized by unwanted, random variations in brightness or color information in an image. It arises during image acquisition (from the sensor), transmission, or processing, and it is not part of the original scene. Preprocessing aims to reduce or remove this noise.

## Common Noise Models

Different physical processes result in different statistical distributions of noise. Understanding these models is crucial for selecting the appropriate filtering technique.

### 1. Additive Noise (Gaussian Noise)

This is the most common noise model. It assumes that the noise value `B(i,j)` is added to the pure image pixel value `IP(i,j)` to produce the corrupted image `IB(i,j)`.

- **Formula:** `IB(i,j) = IP(i,j) + B(i,j)`
- **Characteristics:** The noise values `B` are typically drawn from a Gaussian (normal) distribution with a mean of zero. The standard deviation (`sigma`) of the distribution controls the intensity of the noise.
- **Cause:** Primarily caused by thermal noise in electronic sensors and amplifiers during image acquisition.
- **Appearance:** Fine, grain-like texture distributed across the entire image.

### 2. Impulsive Noise (Salt-and-Pepper Noise)

This noise model affects only a random subset of pixels, replacing them with extreme values (either black or white).

- **Formula:**
  - `IB(i,j) = 0` (pepper) with probability `p/2`
  - `IB(i,j) = 255` (salt) with probability `p/2`
  - `IB(i,j) = IP(i,j)` with probability `1-p`
- **Characteristics:** The noise manifests as sparse black and white dots scattered across the image.
- **Cause:** Often due to sensor defects (dead or stuck pixels), transmission errors in a digital signal, or memory corruption.
- **Insight:** Because the noise corrupts pixels with extreme, non-representative values, filters based on averaging are ineffective. Rank-order filters, like the [[2.3 Non-Linear Spatial Filters (Median, Nagao)|Median filter]], are far more suitable.

### 3. Multiplicative Noise (Speckle Noise)

In this model, the noise value is multiplied by the original pixel value.

- **Formula:** `IB(i,j) = IP(i,j) * B(i,j)`
- **Characteristics:** The noise intensity is proportional to the local image intensity. Brighter regions of the image will appear noisier than darker regions.
- **Cause:** Common in coherent imaging systems such as radar (SAR), sonar, and medical ultrasound.

## Quantifying Degradation

To objectively evaluate the effectiveness of a noise filter, we need metrics to measure the difference between the original (pure) image and the noisy or filtered image.

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared difference between pixel values.
- **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR):** A logarithmic metric derived from the MSE. A higher PSNR generally indicates better image quality.

These metrics are critical for comparing the performance of different filtering algorithms, as covered in [[In-Depth/Image Quality Metrics (PSNR, MSE)]].
