## Course Modules

1.  **Chapter 1: [[01 Introduction to Digital Images/index|Definitions and Basic Concepts of Imaging]]**
    -   This foundational module introduces the [[1.0 What is a Digital Image|digital image]], defining key concepts such as [[1.6 Pixel Relationships and Distance|pixels]], [[1.2 Resolution and Color Depth|resolution]], [[1.3 Color Spaces (RGB, Grayscale, HSL)|color spaces]], and [[1.5 The Image Histogram|histograms]]. It establishes the basic vocabulary and mathematical framework for the rest of the course.

2.  **Chapter 2: [[02 Image Preprocessing and Filtering/index|Image Preprocessing]]**
    -   This module focuses on techniques used to enhance image quality and prepare images for further analysis. Topics include [[2.0 Image Noise and Degradation|noise filtering]], contrast enhancement, and correcting degradations. Both [[2.1 Spatial Domain vs Frequency Domain|spatial and frequency domain]] methods are covered.

3.  **Chapter 3: [[03 Image Segmentation/index|Image Segmentation]]**
    -   Segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions of interest. This module will cover the algorithms used to isolate objects and boundaries within an image.

4.  **Chapter 4: [[04 Feature Extraction/index|Extraction of Characteristic Information]]**
    -   Once regions of interest are identified, this module explores methods for extracting meaningful data (features) from them. This includes describing shapes, colors, and textures in a quantitative way.

5.  **Chapter 5: [[05 Image Similarity and Matching/index|Basic Concepts of Similarity and Image Matching]]**
    -   The final module introduces techniques for comparing images or features. This is fundamental to applications like object recognition, image retrieval, and tracking.
