## Definition

A digital image is a representation of a two-dimensional visual scene that has been acquired, processed, and stored in a numerical format. It is composed of a finite number of discrete elements, called **[[1.6 Pixel Relationships and Distance|pixels]]**, arranged in a rectangular grid or matrix.

Unlike an analog photograph, which has continuous variations in tone, a digital image is inherently discrete. Both its spatial coordinates `(x,y)` and its intensity or color values are quantized into finite numbers. This numerical representation allows a computer to store, process, and display the image.

## The Pixel

The term **pixel** (short for "picture element") is the smallest individual component of a digital image. Each pixel has two primary attributes:

1.  **Position:** Its location within the image grid, defined by a pair of coordinates (e.g., row and column).
2.  **Value:** A numerical value that represents its intensity (for [[1.3 Color Spaces (RGB, Grayscale, HSL)|grayscale images]]) or color (for [[1.3 Color Spaces (RGB, Grayscale, HSL)|color images]]).

An image can be thought of as a function `f(x,y)` where `x` and `y` are spatial coordinates, and the value of `f` at any point `(x,y)` is the pixel's intensity or color.

## Matrix Representation

From a computer science perspective, a digital image is fundamentally a matrix of numbers.

-   **[[1.3 Color Spaces (RGB, Grayscale, HSL)|Grayscale Image]]:** Represented as a 2D matrix where each element contains a single value corresponding to its brightness (e.g., 0 for black, 255 for white).
-   **[[1.3 Color Spaces (RGB, Grayscale, HSL)|Color Image]]:** Typically represented as a 3D matrix (or three separate 2D matrices). Each pixel at `(x,y)` has a set of values, one for each color channel (e.g., Red, Green, and Blue).

**Insight:** This matrix structure is the reason why libraries like NumPy in Python are so central to image processing. They provide highly optimized tools for performing mathematical operations on large arrays of numbers, which directly translates to manipulating images.
