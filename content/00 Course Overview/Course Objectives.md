# Course Objectives: Image Processing and Analysis

This note outlines the primary learning goals and required prerequisites for the course on Image Processing and Analysis.

## Primary Goal

The main objective of this course is to provide students with the foundational knowledge required to master the end-to-end pipeline of digital image processing and analysis. Students will learn to apply specific techniques and algorithms relevant to a broad range of applications in computer vision and artificial intelligence.

Upon completion, students will be able to:
-   Understand the theoretical principles of digital image representation and manipulation.
-   Implement algorithms for image preprocessing, enhancement, and noise reduction.
-   Analyze images to segment regions of interest and extract meaningful features.
-   Evaluate the performance and results of different image processing techniques.
-   Connect theoretical concepts to practical applications in various fields.

## Insight: The "Processing Chain"

The course emphasizes mastering the entire "chaîne de traitement" (processing chain). This is a crucial concept in applied computer vision. It refers to the logical sequence of operations—from initial image acquisition and cleanup (preprocessing) to high-level interpretation (feature extraction and decision-making)—required to solve a real-world problem. Understanding this pipeline is more valuable than knowing isolated algorithms.

## Prerequisites

A solid foundation in the following areas is recommended for success in this course:
-   **Algorithmics and Data Structures:** Essential for understanding and implementing image processing operations efficiently.
-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The practical labs and implementations will rely on programming paradigms often structured within classes and objects.
-   **Foundational Mathematics:** A baseline understanding of concepts from linear algebra (vectors, matrices), calculus, and probability is assumed from prior undergraduate studies.
