# Course Plan

This document outlines the sequential structure of the course, organized into five main chapters. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, following a logical progression from fundamental concepts to advanced analysis techniques.

## Course Modules

1.  **Chapter 1: Definitions and Basic Concepts of Imaging**
    -   This foundational module introduces the digital image, defining key concepts such as pixels, resolution, color spaces, and histograms. It establishes the basic vocabulary and mathematical framework for the rest of the course.

2.  **Chapter 2: Image Preprocessing**
    -   This module focuses on techniques used to enhance image quality and prepare images for further analysis. Topics include noise filtering, contrast enhancement, and correcting degradations. Both spatial and frequency domain methods are covered.

3.  **Chapter 3: Image Segmentation**
    -   Segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions of interest. This module will cover the algorithms used to isolate objects and boundaries within an image.

4.  **Chapter 4: Extraction of Characteristic Information**
    -   Once regions of interest are identified, this module explores methods for extracting meaningful data (features) from them. This includes describing shapes, colors, and textures in a quantitative way.

5.  **Chapter 5: Basic Concepts of Similarity and Image Matching**
    -   The final module introduces techniques for comparing images or features. This is fundamental to applications like object recognition, image retrieval, and tracking.
